🌐 Task #5: Building a Network Packet Analyzer with Python in VS Code 🐍

Excited to share my latest project where I built a network packet analyzer in Python using Visual Studio Code! 🚀

In this task, I dove into the world of networking, leveraging Python's capabilities to 
capture and analyze network packets. The script extracts crucial information such as 
source/destination IP addresses, protocols, and even payload data. It's been a 
fantastic learning experience, combining Python development with network 
fundamentals.

🔍 Key Features:

Captures and analyzes Ethernet frames, IPv4 packets, and TCP headers.
Displays detailed information like MAC addresses, IP addresses, port numbers, TCP flags, and payload data.
Developed responsibly for educational purposes, emphasizing ethical use.

💡 Why Python & VS Code?
Python's simplicity and versatility made it perfect for handling raw network data, while VS Code's integrated terminal and debugging tools streamlined development and testing.

🌟 Learning Outcomes:
This project deepened my understanding of network protocols and Python's networking libraries, reinforcing my skills in network analysis and ethical hacking practices.

🚧 Next Steps:
Looking forward to enhancing the script with UDP support and exploring more advanced network protocols.
